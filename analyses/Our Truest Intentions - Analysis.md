# "Our Truest Intentions"

## Theme

"Our Truest Intentions" is a haunting exploration of the aftermath of a deeply personal relationship's collapse. The poem examines the painful paradox of love—how two people can hold genuine care for each other while simultaneously causing profound harm. The central theme revolves around the disillusionment that comes when pure intentions meet incompatible ways of loving, ultimately leading to the recognition that sometimes the most loving act is letting go.

The title itself carries bitter irony: despite having the "truest intentions," the relationship becomes destructive. This suggests that good intentions, while necessary, are insufficient when fundamental incompatibilities exist between how people express and receive love.

## Interpretation

### The Contradiction of Connection

The opening stanza presents a fundamental question about why people cling to relationships that cause pain. The speaker acknowledges their own role in sending "painful messages" while maintaining hope for reconciliation. This establishes the poem's central tension: the simultaneous desire to connect and the recognition that the connection is harmful.

### Different Languages of Love

The second stanza reveals the core incompatibility: the speaker learned to love "with a whole heart," suggesting complete, vulnerable commitment, while their partner learned to love through the lens of childhood trauma ("broken childhood set alight with fire"). This creates a tragic mismatch—one person offering wholeness to someone whose capacity for love has been shaped by damage and destruction.

### The Desire for Emotional Numbness

The third stanza's imagery of running through "unruly machines" and incinerating feelings represents the speaker's desperate wish to escape the pain of caring. The metaphor of mechanized emotional destruction suggests that natural grief isn't sufficient—the speaker wants industrial-strength elimination of their feelings. The revelation that the partner's "best" involved "directions for giving up" shows how their different approaches to adversity became irreconcilable.

### Navigation and Lost Direction

The fourth stanza employs celestial and geographical metaphors to show how the relationship's purpose has been perverted. The partner transforms from a "North Star" (guidance, constancy, hope) to a "black hole" (destruction, consumption, void). The promise to never leave becomes a "faded road sign / Pointing us to dead ends," suggesting that loyalty itself has become a path to nowhere.

### The Final Betrayal and Transformation

The concluding stanza addresses the ultimate wound: the partner's apparent preference for "fake ones" over genuine connection. The final image of being colored "the bluest of blues" transforms the speaker into an embodiment of sadness—no longer a person experiencing emotion, but emotion itself made manifest.

## Key Imagery

### Fire and Destruction
Fire appears twice—in the partner's "broken childhood set alight with fire" and in the speaker's wish to "incinerate" their feelings. This dual use shows how destructive forces shaped the partner while the speaker actively seeks destruction as an escape from pain.

### Celestial Navigation
The North Star/black hole contrast creates a powerful before-and-after comparison. Stars guide travelers home; black holes consume everything, including light itself. This progression shows how the partner's role in the speaker's life has completely inverted.

### Industrial Imagery
The "unruly machines" metaphor mechanizes emotional processing, suggesting that natural healing isn't sufficient for this level of pain. The speaker wants their feelings processed through something harsh and impersonal.

### Color and Transformation
The final transformation into "the bluest of blues" creates synesthesia—the speaker becomes a color, suggesting that grief has consumed their entire identity. They are no longer a person who feels blue; they have become blueness itself.

### Roads and Direction
The "faded road sign" and "dead ends" imagery reinforces the theme of lost purpose and direction. What once promised to lead somewhere meaningful now only points toward emptiness.

## Emotional Resonance

The poem captures the specific agony of loving someone whose way of loving is fundamentally incompatible with your own. It's not about loving someone who doesn't love you back—it's about loving someone who loves destructively, who has been shaped by trauma into patterns that ultimately harm both parties.

The emotional progression moves from confusion (why do we hold on?) to recognition (we love differently) to desperation (wanting to eliminate feelings) to disillusionment (recognizing the relationship's true nature) and finally to a kind of dissolution (becoming the emotion rather than feeling it).

There's a profound loneliness in realizing that your partner's "best" involves giving up, while your instinct is to fight for the relationship. This creates a dynamic where the more you try to save the relationship, the more you violate your partner's coping mechanisms, and the more they retreat into patterns learned from childhood trauma.

The poem doesn't offer resolution or redemption—instead, it provides a brutally honest accounting of how love can survive even when the relationship cannot, and how that survival of feeling can become its own form of torment. The speaker's final transformation suggests that sometimes grief becomes so complete that it overwrites identity itself.

This analysis reveals "Our Truest Intentions" as a sophisticated meditation on the limits of love, the persistence of trauma, and the painful recognition that sometimes caring for someone means accepting that you cannot save them—or the relationship—no matter how pure your intentions may be.
