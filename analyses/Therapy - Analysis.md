# "Therapy"

## Theme

"Therapy" explores the devastating experience of mental health abandonment and systemic failure within therapeutic institutions. The poem captures the profound vulnerability of seeking help only to be told you're beyond help—a rejection that cuts to the core of human dignity and hope. At its heart, this is a meditation on being "too much" in a world that prefers manageable problems, and the cascading despair that follows when even professional caregivers give up on you.

The central theme revolves around institutional betrayal: the moment when the very system designed to provide healing becomes another source of trauma. The poem examines how bureaucratic language can mask profound cruelty, and how professional boundaries can become weapons that wound rather than protect.

## Interpretation

### The Architecture of Abandonment

The poem's structure mirrors the experience it describes—starting with routine expectation and ending in devastating realization. The speaker approaches therapy with the mundane details of daily life (walking to 15th Street, sitting by the fish tank), but these ordinary moments become the backdrop for extraordinary emotional violence.

The therapist Lauren's question—"Has anyone in your life told you that you're too much to handle?"—initially appears therapeutic, perhaps aimed at exploring patterns of rejection. But it's revealed as setup for institutional rejection, making the therapist complicit in the very dynamic she's supposedly addressing. The irony is crushing: therapy becomes another space where the speaker is told they're "too much."

### The Language of Professional Cruelty

The therapist's dismissal is couched in therapeutic language that attempts to soften its brutality: "we want to provide the best care for you, but we're unable to provide you with what you need here." This corporate speak tries to reframe abandonment as care, rejection as concern. But the speaker sees through this linguistic camouflage—the result is the same regardless of how it's packaged.

### The Counting of Losses

"She was therapist #7" is perhaps the poem's most devastating line. It transforms Lauren from an individual into a statistic, part of a mounting pattern of professional failures. The number implies a history of repeated rejection, each abandonment compounding the last. It suggests a person who has tried repeatedly to get help, only to be passed along or dismissed by mental health professionals who found them too challenging.

### The Finality of Despair

The poem's conclusion—"I'm never going to get better"—represents a surrender born not from lack of effort but from systematic abandonment. This isn't the depression talking; it's the logical conclusion drawn from empirical evidence. When seven professionals have essentially given up, the speaker's despair becomes rational rather than pathological.

## Key Imagery

### Physical Displacement
The detail about not sitting "in my usual place" but being positioned "by the door" is loaded with meaning. Doors represent transitions, exits, departures. The speaker is literally positioned for dismissal before it's even announced. This physical displacement mirrors the emotional displacement they're about to experience.

### The Fish Tank
The fish tank in the waiting room serves as a metaphor for the therapeutic setting itself—a contained, artificial environment where vulnerable creatures (patients) are observed through glass barriers. Fish in tanks are dependent on others for survival, just as therapy patients depend on their therapists' care and commitment.

### Seasonal Symbolism
"It's getting cold this autumn day" isn't just weather reporting—it's pathetic fallacy that mirrors the speaker's internal state. Autumn represents endings, death, the approach of winter's harsh isolation. The physical cold matches the emotional cold of professional rejection.

### The Tissue Box
The tissues placed "next to me" before the devastating news suggest the therapist knew tears were coming. This gesture, which might seem caring, becomes sinister in context—it's preparation for the harm she's about to inflict, making her appear considerate while delivering a crushing blow.

## Emotional Resonance

### The Universality of Being "Too Much"
Many readers will recognize the feeling of being "too much"—too emotional, too needy, too complicated, too damaged. The poem gives voice to those who've been made to feel their very existence is burdensome. It validates the experience of being gaslit into believing that rejection is somehow for your own good.

### Betrayal by Helping Professions
There's particular anguish in being abandoned by those whose job it is to help. The poem captures the unique trauma of professional abandonment—when those trained to provide care instead provide harm. It's a betrayal that attacks not just the individual but their faith in the possibility of help itself.

### The Accumulation of Rejection
The numbering of therapists ("therapist #7") resonates with anyone who's faced repeated professional rejection. It captures the exhausting cycle of hope and disappointment, the way each new attempt at help carries the weight of all previous failures.

### Rational Despair
Perhaps most powerfully, the poem validates despair as a reasonable response to systematic abandonment. "I'm never going to get better" isn't presented as irrational thinking to be challenged, but as a logical conclusion drawn from lived experience. This validation can be both devastating and healing for readers who've been told their despair is just another symptom to overcome.

## Deeper Meanings

### Critique of Mental Health Systems
The poem serves as an indictment of mental health systems that are equipped only to handle "manageable" cases. It exposes how institutions designed to help can become mechanisms of exclusion, abandoning those who need help most. The bureaucratic language used to justify rejection reveals how systems protect themselves rather than serve their stated mission.

### The Violence of Institutional Language
The therapist's carefully worded rejection demonstrates how professional language can be used to commit emotional violence while maintaining plausible deniability. The poem reveals how therapeutic discourse can become a weapon, using care-speak to deliver harm.

### The Existential Impact of Being Deemed "Unfixable"
At its deepest level, the poem explores what it means to be labeled as beyond help. It examines how this designation doesn't just affect one's mental health—it attacks one's fundamental sense of worth and belonging in the world. To be told you're "too much" by multiple professionals is to be told, in effect, that you don't deserve care, that your existence is a problem to be managed rather than a life to be valued.

The poem's power lies in its refusal to soften this reality or provide false comfort. It bears witness to an experience that many face but few discuss openly: the moment when the helping system gives up on you, and you're left to face the implications of that abandonment.
