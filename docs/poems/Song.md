# “Song”

I thought I could’ve loved us forever
But I am just an illness you can’t vibe with

Ten years on and I still feel the numbness
From when I slipped and fell into oblivion
You never came to my rescue and all I wanted was a saviour
Not for forever, just for that day

God’s pledge of peace
Not hurting anyone but myself
The pills said more than I ever did in church
The good ones keep me together
But it takes the bad ones to fill this river
When all I needed was a seat at the docks

But I can’t get you out of my head
It’s like you’ve died and I’m stuck in this grief
A forever longing to be back in your bed
The only thing now is my empty body in between these bloodied sheets
