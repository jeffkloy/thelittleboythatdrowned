# “Attention”

I want your life to be important to me
I want to know about your day, your favourite things,
what you’re passionate about
I want to know these things every day

But I want to know you for more than that
I want to know what turns you on,
what makes you want to lay in bed with a man,
what makes you completely wet
I want to know these things every night
They say it takes two to tango
Will you ask me the same?
Will you care for me as well?
Or am I just somewhere you go to get some attention?

At which point can I learn about your childhood?
At which point can I break down while you hold me?
