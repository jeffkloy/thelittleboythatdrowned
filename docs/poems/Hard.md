# “Hard”

It’s been hard
Hard like my sympathy punches the wall
The wall doesn’t respond to me
I shout from the top of my lungs
But I don’t say a thing

It’s been hard, really
Hard like a trembling “I really want to be with you”
Hard like “You’re such a good person, I’m sure you’ll find someone”
Society doesn’t respond to me
I shed my emotions freely like the depths of oceans
But I’m parched as all hell

I search for some form of solace across the planet
I’m scared of feeling broken again
So I blacken my lungs and drown my sorrows
I’m scared of becoming an addict again

Trees, birds, door, couch, pills
Pills
It’s been hard
