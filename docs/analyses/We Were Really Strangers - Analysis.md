# "We Were Really Strangers"

## Overview

"We Were Really Strangers" presents a moment of raw vulnerability captured in the space between strangers attempting intimacy through a conversation card game. The poem's power lies in its stark simplicity—eleven lines that encapsulate the terror and beauty of human connection, the courage required for honesty, and the inevitable awkwardness that follows genuine emotional risk.

## Theme

### The Paradox of Intimacy
The central theme explores the paradoxical nature of human connection: we crave intimacy yet fear the vulnerability it demands. The poem suggests that true intimacy requires traversing the uncomfortable space between safety and risk, between being strangers and being known. The card game becomes a metaphor for the artificial structures we create to facilitate genuine human connection—rules and prompts that give us permission to be vulnerable.

### The Cost of Honesty
The poem examines what happens when we respond to the call for authentic expression. The speaker's confession "I want to kiss you" represents the kind of truth that changes everything—honest desire that cannot be taken back once spoken. The violent rejection that follows ("Nnnooooooooo!") reveals the real consequences of emotional honesty in a world where we're often safer as strangers.

### Social Scripts and Their Failure
The structured format of the card question creates an expectation of controlled, safe vulnerability. Instead, the interaction spirals beyond the boundaries of the game, demonstrating how genuine human emotion refuses to be contained by artificial frameworks.

## Interpretation

The poem operates on multiple levels simultaneously. On the surface, it's a simple exchange between two people playing what appears to be a relationship-building card game. However, the deeper reading reveals a meditation on the fundamental loneliness of human existence and our desperate, often clumsy attempts to bridge the gap between self and other.

The title "We Were Really Strangers" suggests both a past tense acknowledgment of distance and a revelation—perhaps they thought they knew each other, but this moment revealed how little they truly understood about one another's inner worlds. The word "really" emphasizes the depth of their separation, suggesting layers of unknowing.

The card's question serves as a catalyst, creating a moment of permission for radical honesty. But the speaker's initial resistance ("Can we skip this one?") reveals an intuitive understanding that some truths are dangerous to speak. The encouragement to "Just say it!" becomes almost coercive, pushing past natural protective boundaries.

## Key Imagery

### The Card as Mediator
The card game represents society's attempt to create safe spaces for vulnerability. Cards provide structure, rules, and the illusion of control over emotional risk. The specific question—asking for something one is "afraid to" say—explicitly acknowledges fear as the barrier to authentic communication.

### The Progression of Reluctance to Revelation
The dialogue moves from avoidance ("Can we skip this one?") to encouragement ("Just say it!") to confession ("I want to kiss you") to rejection. This progression mirrors the natural arc of emotional risk—initial self-protection, external pressure, courage, and consequence.

### The Elongated "No"
The final line's "Nnnooooooooo!" is perhaps the poem's most powerful image. The extended, almost comical spelling suggests not just rejection but horror, surprise, and perhaps a desperate attempt to take back what cannot be unsaid. The repetition of vowels creates an auditory sense of time stretching, of a moment becoming eternal.

## Emotional Resonance

### Vulnerability and Shame
The poem captures the particular shame that comes from misreading a situation, from offering something precious (desire, affection) and having it met with revulsion rather than reciprocation. The speaker's confession is brave and genuine, making the rejection feel particularly cruel.

### The Loneliness of Desire
There's a profound loneliness in wanting connection with someone who doesn't want it back. The poem doesn't judge either party—the speaker for wanting what they want, or the other person for not wanting it—but it exposes the fundamental isolation that occurs when desires don't align.

### Humor and Tragedy
The poem walks a delicate line between comedy and tragedy. The elongated "no" could be read as comedic—an over-the-top reaction to an unwanted advance. Yet it also carries real pain: the death of possibility, the awkwardness that will forever change their dynamic, the knowledge that they've crossed a line that cannot be uncrossed.

### The Universality of Rejection
Most readers will recognize themselves in this moment—either as the person taking the emotional risk or as the person who must somehow respond to unwanted romantic attention. This universality gives the poem its emotional power.

## Deeper Meanings

### The Impossibility of True Connection
The poem suggests that perhaps we are all fundamentally strangers to one another, separated by the subjectivity of our individual experiences. The card game represents our various attempts to bridge this gap—through questions, through shared activities, through artificial intimacy—but genuine connection remains elusive and dangerous.

### The Performance of Intimacy
The structured nature of the card game highlights how much of our "intimate" communication is actually performative. We follow scripts, ask prescribed questions, and expect certain types of responses. When someone breaks the script with genuine desire, the performance breaks down entirely.

### The Moment Before and After
The poem captures a moment of transformation—the instant when two people's understanding of their relationship changes forever. There's a "before" (when the confession was unspoken) and an "after" (when it cannot be taken back), and the poem exists in that liminal space where everything shifts.

### The Courage of Confession
Despite the painful outcome, there's something heroic about the speaker's honesty. In a world where we often hide our true feelings to protect ourselves and others, the act of saying "I want to kiss you" represents a kind of emotional bravery, even if it's met with rejection.

## Conclusion

"We Were Really Strangers" achieves remarkable depth through radical compression. In eleven lines, it captures the full arc of human vulnerability—from protection to risk to consequence. The poem doesn't offer comfort or resolution; instead, it presents the truth of human connection: that it's always a risk, that we never fully know another person, and that sometimes our attempts at intimacy only serve to highlight our fundamental isolation.

Yet there's also beauty in the attempt. The speaker's willingness to voice their desire, despite knowing the risk, represents the essentially human drive to connect, to be known, to bridge the gap between self and other. Even in failure, even in rejection, there's something profound about the willingness to try.

The poem ultimately suggests that being strangers might be our natural state—that all human connection is an attempt to overcome this essential separation, and that sometimes the attempt itself is what matters, regardless of the outcome.
