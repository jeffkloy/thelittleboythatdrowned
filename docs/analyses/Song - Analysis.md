# "Song"

## Theme

"Song" is a haunting exploration of abandonment, mental health struggles, and the lingering trauma of unrequited love. The poem weaves together themes of emotional numbness, self-destruction, and the desperate search for salvation in another person. At its core, it examines how untreated emotional wounds can fester over time, turning love into a form of prolonged grief.

The central theme revolves around the speaker's identity as "an illness" - suggesting both self-perception as a burden and the way depression can make one feel fundamentally unlovable. This self-awareness becomes both a source of pain and a barrier to healing.

## Interpretation

The poem unfolds as a meditation on a relationship that ended a decade ago but continues to define the speaker's emotional landscape. The title "Song" suggests this pain has become the speaker's constant refrain, a melody they cannot escape.

The narrative arc moves from initial hope ("I thought I could've loved us forever") through abandonment and crisis ("when I slipped and fell into oblivion") to present-day numbness and ongoing self-harm. The speaker reveals a pattern of seeking external salvation rather than internal healing, first from their lover, then from religion, and finally from medication.

The most striking element is how the poem treats the absent lover as simultaneously dead and alive - dead to the relationship but alive in memory, creating a liminal state of unresolved grief.

## Key Imagery

### Water and Drowning Metaphors
The poem employs water imagery to represent both destruction and the possibility of peace. "Oblivion" suggests falling into dark waters, while "fill this river" transforms the speaker's pain into a flowing body of water. The "seat at the docks" represents the desired position of safety - close to the water (emotional depth) but not drowning in it.

### Religious Symbolism
"God's pledge of peace" and the reference to church create a spiritual framework, but one that has failed the speaker. The pills become more communicative than prayer, suggesting that pharmaceutical intervention speaks to pain in ways that faith could not.

### Medical/Chemical Language
The "illness" metaphor extends throughout, with pills divided into "good ones" that maintain stability and "bad ones" that feed the destructive river. This clinical language distances the speaker from their own emotional experience while simultaneously making it concrete and treatable.

### Death and Grief Imagery
The final stanza transforms the absent lover into a deceased person, making the speaker's ongoing attachment a form of mourning. The "bloodied sheets" suggest both literal self-harm and metaphorical evidence of emotional wounds.

## Emotional Resonance

The poem's power lies in its unflinching honesty about depression's long-term effects. The ten-year timespan emphasizes how trauma can calcify, creating permanent emotional numbness rather than healing. There's a profound loneliness in the speaker's voice - abandoned by their lover, unable to connect with faith, and left only with the artificial management of medication.

The emotional progression moves from active pain to passive endurance. The speaker no longer seeks dramatic rescue but simply "a seat at the docks" - a modest desire for stability that feels almost impossibly distant.

The final image of lying alone in "bloodied sheets" creates visceral empathy while suggesting that the speaker's pain has become self-perpetuating. The absence of the other person has been filled not with healing or new love, but with self-destruction.

## Deeper Meanings

Beneath its surface narrative of lost love, "Song" explores several profound themes:

**The Medicalization of Emotional Pain**: The poem questions whether pharmaceutical intervention can truly address spiritual and emotional wounds, or whether it merely manages symptoms while deeper issues remain unresolved.

**Codependency and Self-Worth**: The speaker's identity as "an illness" reveals how depression can warp self-perception, making one feel inherently unlovable rather than temporarily struggling.

**The Persistence of Trauma**: The ten-year gap suggests that some emotional wounds don't heal with time alone - they require active intervention and often professional help that the speaker hasn't yet found.

**Spiritual Bankruptcy**: The failure of both human love and religious faith leaves the speaker in an existential void, searching for meaning through chemical means.

**The Paradox of Survival**: The speaker continues to exist but questions whether this constitutes living. The "good" pills keep them "together" but don't restore joy or connection.

The poem ultimately serves as both confession and warning - a raw documentation of how untreated mental health issues can transform love into a form of slow-motion drowning, where the only constant companion is the pain itself.
