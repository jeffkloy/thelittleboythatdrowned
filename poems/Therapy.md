# “Therapy”

I walked to the clinic on 15th St
Sat down next to the fish tank
Lauren calls me in to her office
Ten minutes later than my appointment

She asks me to sit down
It’s not in my usual place
Why am I by the door?
Lauren asks me “Has anyone in your life told you that you’re too much to handle?”
I say yes
I mean, why would I lie?
She places the box of tissues next to me
I don’t understand

“I spoke with my supervisory board and we want to provide the best care for you, but we’re unable to provide you with what you need here”

I walk out onto the street
It’s getting cold this autumn day
She was therapist #7
I’m never going to get better
