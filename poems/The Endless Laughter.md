# “The Endless Laughter”
Some days I want to find love,
because there’s nothing greater to me than
having endless laughter and someone to hold.
But then I look back at everyone in pain,
a pain I already have these days,
when I think everyone hates me,
and nothing I could do
would make it better.
Some days I feel like I am the inside joke,
the endless laughter.
