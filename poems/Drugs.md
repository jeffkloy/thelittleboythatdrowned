# “Drugs”

An exhale of smoke
   A few milliseconds of confusion
Two hours of bliss
   I can live here without you

It’s when I get sober
   does it feel bad
I didn’t notice the mess I created
Until I think I pawned our life away
   Your life, sorry

Blue sky, birds, the smell of croissants
   I am waking up for the first time in ages
   In a gutter on the street
Guess I’ve been out of it
