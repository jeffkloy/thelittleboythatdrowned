# “Our Truest Intentions”

Why do we hold onto each other?
You to my painful messages
And me to a hope that one day we’ll be true again

So damn my purest intentions
I only learned how to love
With a whole heart and not just by desire
You only learned how to love
By way of a broken childhood set alight with fire

Run me through the most unruly of machines
For I’ve a wish to incinerate my feelings
Because I always dreamt the best for you
But your best was directions for giving up

I thought you were my North Star
But you’re as putrid as a black hole
And this promise I made to you
The one where I’d never leave you behind
Is now a faded out road sign
Pointing us to dead ends

To the fake ones that never stuck with you through the turmoil of what we’ve built together
Why did you even once accept me at all?
Only to lose the truest of trues
Colouring me the bluest of blues
