# “Lovable”

I think God messed up with everyone else

See, I was born with several disorders, so I look different than everyone and I grew up to be nobody’s type
See, God also gave me a troubled mind, and a heart I, one day, hope would grow so huge that it could capture the warmth of the sun and turn it into happiness for anyone who becomes afraid every time it goes down

See, no, I don’t think He made me unloveable

He made other people unable to love me

See, I’d love anyone
Just as if they already loved
Me a million times over
