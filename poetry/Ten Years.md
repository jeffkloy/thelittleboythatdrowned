# “Ten Years”

We met in your favourite city
The city that’s so nice they named it twice
You were so nice to me, I think
I felt comfortable for once in someone else’s presence

I miss our late night phone calls
And I miss the way I could poke fun of you and you knew I meant no harm
And how you’d ask me for my opinion on everything
And you’d invite me to your work
And you’d invite me to all your outings
I never knew you were leading me on
And never wanted me the way I wanted you

I should’ve died that night
That bottle of pills seemed forgiving
What was it forgiving me for?
Why can’t I get you out of my head?
You’re so beautiful

I stopped doing drugs for both of us
You stopped talking to me because I called you a cunt
And I only did that because you got a boyfriend
And I only did that because you stopped calling me or inviting me out every day
I apologized for years

I apologized the first year
I apologized the third year
I apologized the fifth year

We finally became friends again
I thought my world was in repair
I thought the universe placed you back for a reason
Perhaps so I could hold you

You stopped talking to me again
I don’t know why
