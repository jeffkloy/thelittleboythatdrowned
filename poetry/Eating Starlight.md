# “Eating Starlight”

The first time I saw her,

I wanted to mess around and have some fun

The second time I saw her,

I wanted to continue having our first conversation

The third time I saw her,

I wanted to say “hello” by giving her a really meaningful hug

And every time after,

I wanted to eat starlight for eternity

What does starlight taste like?
Imagine chewing into a million Starburst candies

Times that by the peak of a weed high

Times that again by pi

It’s the moment you open the door and your heart flutters
When she walks in, everything in time just stops

You are so proud that she’s yours

You finally feel like yourself

It’s the moment you both lay your head down the first time
you’re not having sex

When she gently lays her head onto your pillow,
pushing up on your side

And you can smell the scent of her hair
You put your arm around her,

Everything in time just stops

It’s the moment you’re both out on your first trip

To somewhere you’ve both never been
But it already feels like your favourite city

As if every nook and cranny was now a comfortable surprise

The taste of the foods she places onto your tongue
The liquor that got you both up dancing in the middle of the square

It’s the moment you find out that you’re having a baby
From both your bloodlines; you’re going to be so proud of it

You’re going to kiss your lover every day until this baby comes out

You’re going to kiss your child every day til it hates you

But right now, it’s smiles all around

It’s the moment you’re at her hospital bed

Kidney cancer, stage 4
The doctor comes in and tells you that she only has a few weeks left
But it hurts too much to get up and out

You ask if there’s anything you can do,

and you hold on

Remember how we times’d Starbursts and weed highs by pi?
We times’d it by pi, because we still don’t
have a clue

what it truly feels like

when it all eventually ends
