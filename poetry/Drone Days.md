# “Drone Days”

Some days, depression hits me like a train the moment I wake up
It’s always bad dream after bad dream
Usually I dream about someone I adore having sex with someone else, and I can’t open the door to confront them, or else it’s the typical dream about rejection
I wake up sweating, but the weight of my brain makes it impossible to shower
Why shower?, I’ve never felt cleaner after anyway

I take my medication just to be safe
I don’t take it because I should, only because I have to - or else the day will be me curling up on the couch, falling asleep, and having the same bad dreams; or, me posting every thought I have onto social media; or, me contemplating how I can off myself for real this time
Who am I kidding?, I’m going to lay on the couch anyway, feel numb, and scroll through social media until I fall asleep
I need to eat
Since childhood, I’ve been banned from using the stove so I only somewhat learned how to cook; everyone was afraid I’d burn myself or the house down intentionally
I order in
$25 for something only worth a third of the price; all of the day’s budget
I get to work, automate myself out of a job, and let the hours pass

Nighttime comes
I’m scared again
Are there drugs laying around? No? Good
Are there beers in the fridge? No? Good
No one notices until I post 10 stories onto social media
I always expect the messages to flood in, from anyone,
But seldom do they ever do

Eventually I pass out from, once again, laying on the couch
I *get to* repeat this tomorrow
