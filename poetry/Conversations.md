# “Conversations”

A friend that thinks they know you:
Hi again
I’m glad we met
How are you?
No, how are you, really?
What do you mean?
Why are there bottles on the floor?
Did you remember to take your meds?
Please take your meds

A lover that didn’t expect your impulsivity:
Hey there
Where are you?
Sounds amazing! Did you plan this long ago? You never told me about it
What do you mean, you don’t know how you’re going to get back?
Do you need me to come get you?
Why did you go if you didn’t know how you’d survive?
Did you remember to take your meds?

A fight about nothing:
Hey
What’s up?
I’m sorry???
What did I do???
Can you calm down???
I can’t understand why you’re so mad
Please stop yelling!!!
I’m going to hang up now. No, not until you calm down
Goodbye

15 minutes before the sirens:
Hey
Can we talk?
I’m sorry, I don’t think I can handle “us” anymore
You’re just too much and it’s draining
I’m sorry
There’s nothing you can do
I’m sorry
Look, I just don’t think we’re right for each other
I have to go
Please don’t hurt yourself
