# “11 Moments From Love”

When they ask, “What did you want from her?”, I’ll know what my answer will be.

1. I want to wake up next to her every morning and ask her what her dreams were about.
2. I want to make breakfast in bed, and then make her go to the kitchen because we shouldn’t eat in bed.
3. I want to make her tea just the way she likes it.

Two sugars, a dash of milk, and nothing less.
1. I want to kiss her goodbye every morning and wish her the best day at work.
2. I want to come home to her every afternoon and listen to how her day was, and learn how she felt when this and that happened at the office.
3. I want to curl up with her on the sofa as we put on our favourite show, even though we’ve seen it 5 times already.
4. I want to take her out to dinner in places we have only heard about but never tried before. She could have any appetizer and any course, and the only judgement I would pass is if she didn’t get her favourite dessert after.
5. I want to take her travelling across the seas and stand with her on the top of the tallest tower in an obscure European city, and breathe in deeply before we yell, “It’s you and me against the world.”
6. I want to hold her hand when she’s sad and tell her that everything eventually goes back to being okay, and that’s not a lie.
7. I want to walk with her through the park in silence, because we’re so comfortable with each other that we don’t have to always talk.
8. I want to hug her, like, really hug her time and time again, enjoying each embrace like it was our last.

I don’t want to be a memory.
I don’t want to be an option passed up.
I want to be chosen, just once.
Because I’d choose her any day.
