3. What’s it feel like in your head when the alcohol pervades and your emotional state gets more repressive?
4. What’s the second thing that pops into your head when you’ve started taking your anger out on those who love you?
5. Ten seconds into yelling, do you feel like there is no way back?
6. After the fight, do you feel regret or does anger still pervade?
