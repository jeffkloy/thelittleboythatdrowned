# “Delivered / Read”

They say that:
  If you are important to someone
  They will make time for you
  No excuses, no lies, no broken promises
That hit different that morning

But I didn’t know how to tell her that
Without her thinking that I was clingy,
or, in the depths of love for her;
which I wasn’t

I just got tired of never being important enough to have the chance to be chosen
