# "Blackwell's Light"

There was a time when they built the light to warn the others that old enemies were coming
They thought it would bring everyone some sense of safety
Never did they think that one day in the future that things would regress

There was a boy that had hope, and loss, and hope, and loss
He would visit the light when he felt his lowest
It was a place so close to the water’s edge and it taught him that he could be so close to his own enemies
The devil in his bloodstream
Never did he think that one day in the future that his people wouldn’t look for him there
Unless he jumped

It was never supposed to be his sad place
His mother adored the light as it brought her a sense of serenity
He grew up learning to stand back from the ledge, because there was supposed to be nothing less than a deliverance of architectural artistry
It was never supposed to be his own despondency

There was a girl who grew up with such bad luck
She never had visited the light
The boy told her about it many times and how he wanted to take her one day
To show her that his dark place was meant to be light; a loss was meant to be hope

But all she wanted was to hide away
A carefully crafted place inside of her head
Safe from the darkness of her past
Safe from his darkness of the light
Though never could she really run away from herself
Unless she jumped

In the end, the light has its purpose
Whether it’s to shine a light or darken your curse
You are free to bring your interpretation
For its beauty should be shared nonetheless
