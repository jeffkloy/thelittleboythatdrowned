# "Little Old Me"

Of all the things I couldn’t do
Skydiving over cliffs that crowned the coast
Marrying my once best friend
Driving sleek cars toward the shore
Dancing all night beneath a field of stars
At least the weight of feeling inadequate has lifted once again

Back then, I wanted so much to be strong
Now, I’m back to whoever I really am
A place I don’t fully comprehend

Of all the things I can do
Live in the greatest city in America
And still find myself back on the road
Writing to everyone from Cuba
With more friends than ever to keep me steady
And more ideas than before to carry me forward

In the end,
I’m just little old me
What else can I ask for?What else can I do?
