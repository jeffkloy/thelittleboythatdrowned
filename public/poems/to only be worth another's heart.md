# "to only be worth another's heart"

i feel too much, and every time it gets bad, i tell my friends and family that they don't need to worry about me so much,
or pay attention to the songs i share with them, and that i could never expect them to save me; i know they can't, and they'll kill themselves on the inside trying; but honestly, when i get so low and feel so broken, i just want to scream so loud that it is a shot heard across the world and cry so much that all of my insides dry out, "but i really just want to be loved and to be in love with."

i remind my mother that she can be there for me all of her life, but she can't expect that when she's gone or passed away that things won't get so hard for me again, and she'll never be able to save me from afar or from heaven, and i'd more than likely not die from natural causes, but from a painful doing of my own self.

i don't think anyone who doesn't have borderline or a deep depression will ever understand the internal pain, but on an unchosen day years from now, it will become so hard for me again that i could imagine nothing less than to die in front of someone that i've given my all for that just couldn't love me back, and people would wonder if there was any way they could've saved me and they'd battle all of these theories, when all it really was was that
"i just wanted to be worth as much as everything i gave away."
