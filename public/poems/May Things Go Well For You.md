# "May Things Go Well For You"

Hey, honey
May things go well for you this year
I hope you find the things you want
I hope you find the people you need

Meanwhile back in our old home
I lay here contemplating
How we were marriage-bound
Two months later, into nothing at all

I know how I asked to finally be let go
And I turned silence into our love language
But I'll never comprehend the emotions you've had
The anger, the distance, the indifference

But, hey, honey
I will always love you
So may things go well for you for forever
