# "How The Little Boy Drowned: An Introduction"

A cloudy day at the beach

A boy runs into the water, excited to get into the sea
The waves suddenly build up as the weather turns for the worse

Everything is crashing all around him
The waterline is rising higher and over his head

As he goes under, he calls for help and puts his arms out for survival
A hand grabs him, and in a second, it lets go

"I'm not the one to help you"
