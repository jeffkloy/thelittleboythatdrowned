# "Nobody Knows The Real Me"

"You're so easy to talk to"
Nobody knows the real me
The moments that sit there with me quietly
Each second filled with sadness

"But you're so smart"
Again, nobody knows the real me
Each word spewing out faster than my thoughts
Nothing more than afraid of saying something wrong,
something despondent

"And you've travelled to so many places"
Like I said, Nobody knows the real me
My loneliness knows every road
I'm fearful of reaching a dead end
One day, there'd be no turning back
That curve could turn into a cliff

"Oh, you've got so many good things going for you"
Once and for all, nobody knows the real me
The good doesn't feel good, and the achievements don't feel like they matter
The only thing I want is to be loved, to be chosen
I keep repeating myself, but nobody hears me
They just keep going on, as if I would do the same
But what if, one day, I just don't?
