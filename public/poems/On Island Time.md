# "On Island Time"

Tired of an endless row of yards and houses
I moved east once more to somehow find something
A place I could be proud of, or brag about

From city to city, town to town
I found solace among the waves
As they crash into the seawall
The coastline, the skyline, my lifeline
Yet another mimicry of home

And here I looked for urbanity
Throngs of people passing my doorstep from dawn to dusk
But it tired me
For the sights and the sounds are nothing but calamity

And for now, I find a place to call home
This suburban urbanism
The same ol' people passing my doorstep from dawn to dusk
And for now, I live on island time
Yet another mimicry of home
