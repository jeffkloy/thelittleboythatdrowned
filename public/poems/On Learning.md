# "On Learning"

What makes me miss her?
It’s the conversations we had,
the constant laughter,
the inside jokes,
our familiar interests,
our love of travel,
our love of music,
the way she always wanted me around.

What makes me break?
The way I was meant to just be around,
but she never wanted to learn my mother tongue.
She said it just didn’t sound nice,
but she was always just waiting for someone else to speak poetically to.
