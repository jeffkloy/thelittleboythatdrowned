# "On Learning"

What makes me miss her?
It’s the conversations we had,
the constant laughter,
the inside jokes,
our familiar interests,
our familiar cuisines,
our love of travel,
our love of music,
the way she always wanted me around.

What makes me break?
The way I was just meant to stick around,
or how she wanted me to fix my teeth - the only reminder left of my suicide attempt,
or how she didn't want my beloved dog to sleep in bed with us.
But mostly, because she never wanted to learn my mother tongue.
She said it just didn’t sound nice,
but she was always just waiting for someone else to speak poetically to.
