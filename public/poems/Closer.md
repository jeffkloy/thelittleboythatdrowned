# “Closer”

To bond over shared beliefs
That turned into shared truths
The revolutionaries in us just wanted
A better life for ourselves
A better life for others

Close to your beers
You threw your always-drunk anger out on everyone
Now from our room to the street
Yet once "from the river to the sea"

Close to your fears
You couldn’t trust anyone
And I wanted so badly to be your safe space
To be your sacred heart, your one and only

But you loved me, yet longed for someone else
And he consumed all of your thoughts
And he consumed all of mine
About you

I swear we tried, but we broke apart
You said you don’t give up on the souls you love
So I guess I wasn’t loved, or I wasn’t a soul
But I swear we tried, and I

I broke apart
Infantilised, inadequate, inherently alone
Once again, I am just the little boy that drowned
