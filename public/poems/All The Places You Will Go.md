# All The Places You Will Go

I lost my head once in Amsterdam
I tasted luxury in Bangkok
I realised I could love a ghost in Cape Town
I overindulged myself in Las Vegas
I felt on top of the world in London
I learned who I was in San Francisco
I found my calling in Sydney
I felt like myself most with newfound friends in Tokyo

I've been travelling since I was a child
Never really liked the way we went about it
But I knew that every city and every park would be wild
And that in my heart, there'd be some places that would fit

Of all the places you will go
Each place will ignite a different spark of yours
Keep exploring, never just outright say no
Don't let your career or relationships stop you from going on tour
You'll never regain that time that made you not go

You might eventually grow jaded, but you'll never stop surprising yourself
