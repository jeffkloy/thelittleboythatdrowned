# "I Woke Up Low Again (August 5th)"

I haven't showered in almost a week
I didn't even prepare the tub for fear that I might force myself to drown

I keep staring at my phone hoping I'd get
a message from someone I completely adored
That now I'm scared of that every conversation
will turn into a one-sided argument
Them mad at me over something I can never understand

Today, I woke up low again
Today, I woke up anguished again
There's bouts of wanting to survive
There's bouts of wanting to just... die

It's not that I think I'm a burden; I used to
Because in reality, it's them causing pain onto others
And not me feeling like I'm "too much" or "too clingy"
But me not wanting to live with the fact that
I am still somewhat in love with someone
who doesn't love me the way I need to be loved
Someone I loved in a way that was so gentle

And maybe if I don't die, then
One day I'll find someone who will love me right
Someone who will calm my storms
Or ease my eternal pain

I wish I was just happy to be a part of something
I wish I was just happy to be a contender
