# “California”

Humboldt was the first time I had an out-of-body experience;
It was a cloudy day
We were at a town square and someone handed me free weed cake
Why would I say no?
I spent the night in the forest with my head in space, higher than the clouds could ever reach, farther than any human touch, more distant than anywhere my love would ever be waiting for me to come home
I landed back on Earth and nothing changed
Everyone was the same
Everything was the same
Space travel as a farce

San Francisco was the first time I was able to admit I had a polysubstance addiction;
It was when I was on the phone with her
She asked me if I was sober
I would never dare lie to her
I took a bunch of street pills an hour before
Weed to calm me down
Amphetamine to balance it out
I sat on my bed feeling so poorly that I disappointed her
All I wanted was to be her world
I couldn’t even be present in my own

Santa Monica was the first time I banned myself from going to the beach;
The pier at nighttime was nearly empty
All I could hear are the waves
Crashing into the shoreline
I reach the fisherman’s’ refuge
The moon shined down onto the water
Such a beautiful way to die
I wonder if Virginia needed a friend
Such a burning of the insides
But LA didn’t need another washed up boy
And I can see her some other time

Pasadena was the first time I came to realize I’ve made it as an adult,
but West Covina was the first time I really felt at home;
Stuffed animals surround me
My mom cooking grilled cheese at 3 AM
The earthquake that shoved us across the room
My mom never let me fall out of her arms
The first time I fell in love at 12
The 8 times I tried to kill myself at 13
The way I found my best friends
Illegal campfires in the hills
The way I held her hand as we looked over the city
We ran from the police so many times
The funny way they found me out at 18
The big time I tried to kill myself at 20
My first rehab
The only time I tried to pick up a townie hooker and found out she went to school with me so I couldn’t go through with it
My parents at 75
My parents at 85
My parents at 95
I can be gone most my life
but home is there forever
