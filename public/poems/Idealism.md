# "Idealism"

I had difficult wonderful thoughts the other night
My mind went, "What if we worked out?"

But I have a fear that I'm just a hopeless romantic
The lonely broken soul who idealises someone
who would never be theirs again

Because we fight
And we hurt
And you want someone so far away
That I mostly think is far-fetched
But I really think is stupid

Yet I would never stop you from your dreams
Because that would make me someone
I could never dream to be
And to do that would mean that I never truly cared

But in my difficult wonderful thoughts,
I saw you shaking hands with important people
I saw you being praised for doing the groundwork
I saw us sharing inside jokes together all night
I saw us travelling to places we once dreamt of
I saw us spreading blankets on the beach
I saw us walking down the aisle
I saw our kids playing in the yard
I saw you feeling fulfilled
I saw us living happy

I want everything to work out
Not just for you, not just for me, but just for us
But I might just live a life as the lonely broken soul
I'm so used to it from everyone else in my past
that I might claim it as my state of permanence

Even though we're still friends
I want to write happy poems again
