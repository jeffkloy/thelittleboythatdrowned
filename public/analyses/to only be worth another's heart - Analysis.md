# "to only be worth another's heart"

## Theme

This poem explores the profound loneliness and emotional vulnerability that comes with mental illness, particularly borderline personality disorder and depression. The central theme revolves around the desperate human need for love and validation, and the tragic disconnect between what the speaker gives to others versus what they receive in return. The poem examines the weight of emotional burden on both the sufferer and their loved ones, while ultimately revealing that beneath all the pain lies a simple, heartbreaking desire: to feel worthy of love.

The title itself encapsulates this theme—the speaker doesn't want grand gestures or material worth, but simply to be valued as much as a human heart, to be worth someone's love and emotional investment.

## Interpretation

### The Burden of Emotional Labor

The poem opens with the speaker's awareness of their own emotional intensity and the toll it takes on others. There's a painful self-awareness here—they recognize that their struggles are exhausting for their loved ones, leading them to preemptively release others from the obligation to save them. This creates a tragic paradox: the more the speaker tries to protect others from their pain, the more isolated they become.

### Maternal Relationship and Mortality

The second stanza introduces the speaker's relationship with their mother, grounding the abstract emotional pain in a specific, tender relationship. The speaker's brutal honesty about their likely fate—death by their own hand rather than natural causes—serves as both a warning and a resignation. This isn't manipulation but rather a stark acknowledgment of their mental health reality.

### The Specificity of Mental Illness

The speaker makes an important distinction about who can truly understand their pain, acknowledging that those without borderline personality disorder or severe depression cannot fully comprehend the internal experience. This isn't dismissive but rather recognizes the unique, often indescribable nature of these conditions.

### The Final Revelation

The poem builds to its devastating conclusion: that all the complex theories people might have about prevention and salvation miss the simple truth. The speaker doesn't need to be saved from some external force—they need to feel valued and loved in proportion to what they give.

## Key Imagery

### Auditory Imagery
- **"scream so loud that it is a shot heard across the world"** - This powerful metaphor transforms personal anguish into something with global resonance, suggesting the speaker's pain is so intense it could alert the entire world. The reference to "shot heard 'round the world" (from the American Revolution) elevates personal suffering to historically significant levels.

### Physical/Bodily Imagery
- **"cry so much that all of my insides dry out"** - The image of complete emotional and physical depletion, suggesting grief so consuming it would literally drain the body of moisture and life.
- **"kill themselves on the inside trying"** - The internal destruction that comes from attempting to save someone who cannot be saved through external effort alone.

### Spatial and Temporal Imagery
- **"from afar or from heaven"** - The impossibility of rescue across distance or even death, emphasizing the isolation inherent in mental illness.
- **"on an unchosen day years from now"** - The randomness and inevitability the speaker feels about their mental health crises.

### The Central Metaphor
- **"to be worth as much as everything i gave away"** - This transforms love and emotional investment into currency, highlighting the speaker's sense of operating at an emotional deficit, always giving more than they receive.

## Emotional Resonance

### Vulnerability and Raw Honesty
The poem's power lies in its unflinching honesty about mental illness and suicidal ideation. The speaker doesn't romanticize their pain or ask for pity—instead, they offer a clear-eyed assessment of their condition and its likely trajectory.

### Universal Themes Within Specific Experience
While the poem speaks specifically to the experience of borderline personality disorder and depression, it touches on universal human needs: the desire to be valued, to have one's emotional investments reciprocated, and to feel worthy of love.

### The Paradox of Self-Awareness
There's a tragic irony in the speaker's acute self-awareness. They understand their condition, its impact on others, and even predict its likely outcome, yet this knowledge doesn't provide protection or salvation. This highlights how mental illness can persist despite insight and intelligence.

### Love as Both Solution and Problem
The poem reveals love as simultaneously the answer to the speaker's pain and the source of it. They crave love ("i really just want to be loved and to be in loved with") but also fear that their need for love burdens others. The final lines suggest that reciprocal love—feeling valued as much as they value others—might be the key to their survival.

### Protective Isolation
The speaker's attempts to shield others from their pain ("they don't need to worry about me so much") create a heartbreaking isolation. This protection becomes its own form of suffering, as the speaker bears their burden alone while desperately needing connection.

## Conclusion

"to only be worth another's heart" is a profound meditation on mental illness, love, and human worth. It captures the specific experience of conditions like borderline personality disorder while speaking to broader human needs for validation and reciprocal love. The poem's strength lies not in its despair but in its clarity—it strips away the complicated theories and explanations to reveal a simple, devastating truth about what it means to feel unloved and unworthy in a world where you give everything you have to others.

The poem serves as both a window into the experience of severe mental illness and a plea for understanding: that sometimes the most complex human suffering has the simplest solution—to feel valued and loved in return.
