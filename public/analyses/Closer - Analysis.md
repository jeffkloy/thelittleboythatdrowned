# "Closer"

## Theme

"Closer" is a devastating exploration of intimacy's paradoxes—how physical and ideological proximity can coexist with profound emotional distance. The poem traces the dissolution of a relationship built on shared revolutionary ideals, revealing how even the most passionate connections can founder on the rocks of emotional unavailability and divided loyalties. At its heart, this is a poem about the tragedy of asymmetrical love, where one partner's complete emotional offering meets another's fundamental inability to receive it.

The title itself embodies the central irony: the speaker draws "closer" to various aspects of their partner—their anger, their fears—yet this closeness only illuminates the unbridgeable distance between them. The poem interrogates what it means to be close to someone who is emotionally elsewhere, transforming proximity from a comfort into a form of torture.

## Interpretation

The poem opens with a foundation of shared idealism: "To bond over shared beliefs / That turned into shared truths." This progression from "beliefs" to "truths" suggests a deepening of connection, a movement from theoretical alignment to lived experience. The "revolutionaries in us" evokes both political activism and the revolutionary act of love itself—the desire to transform not just society but each other's lives.

However, this utopian beginning quickly gives way to a darker reality. The structure "Close to your beers / You threw your always-drunk anger out on everyone" introduces the partner's destructive patterns. The specificity of "always-drunk anger" suggests not occasional outbursts but a chronic condition, a perpetual state of rage lubricated by alcohol. The spatial progression "from our room to the street" shows how this anger cannot be contained within the private sphere but spills out into public space.

The reference "from the river to the sea" is particularly loaded, echoing the Palestinian liberation slogan while also suggesting the boundlessness of the partner's anger. This transforms a phrase associated with hope and freedom into one of overwhelming, uncontainable emotion—a corruption of their shared revolutionary ideals.

The speaker's response to this chaos is heartbreaking in its selflessness: "And I wanted so badly to be your safe space / To be your sacred heart, your one and only." The religious imagery of "sacred heart" elevates the speaker's love to the level of devotion, offering themselves as a sanctuary from the partner's demons. Yet this offering is met with the crushing revelation: "But you loved me, yet longed for someone else."

The poem's emotional center lies in the triangulation: "And he consumed all of your thoughts / And he consumed all of mine / About you." This creates a perverse intimacy where the speaker and their partner are united only through their mutual obsession with the absent third party. The repetition of "consumed" suggests a devouring, destructive force that leaves all parties emotionally starved.

The final movement of the poem charts complete psychological dissolution. The progression from "we broke apart" to "I broke apart" shows how the relationship's failure becomes internalized as personal disintegration. The triplet "Infantilised, inadequate, inherently alone" creates an alliterative catalog of regression and isolation, each word beginning with "in-" emphasizing negation and internality.

## Key Imagery

**Sacred and Profane Juxtaposition**: The poem consistently contrasts elevated spiritual language ("sacred heart," "souls you love") with earthly realities ("beers," "always-drunk anger"). This tension reflects the speaker's attempt to sanctify a relationship that remains stubbornly grounded in dysfunction.

**Spatial Dynamics**: The poem maps emotional distance through physical spaces—from the intimate "our room" to the public "street," from the political-geographic "river to the sea" to the metaphysical space of being someone's "safe space." Each spatial reference emphasizes containment's failure and boundaries' permeability.

**The Drowning Child**: The poem's culminating image—"the little boy that drowned"—operates on multiple levels. It suggests regression to childhood vulnerability, the suffocation of being in an impossible relationship, and a kind of ego death. The passive construction "that drowned" implies both helplessness and a completed action, a fate already sealed.

**Consumption Metaphor**: The verb "consumed" transforms love from nourishment to destruction. This cannibalistic imagery suggests how obsessive love devours the self, leaving nothing behind but hunger.

## Literary Techniques

**Anaphora and Repetition**: The repeated "Close to your" creates a litany structure that emphasizes the speaker's proximity to different aspects of their partner while highlighting their inability to reach the partner's emotional core. The repetition of "A better life" similarly shows how shared ideals can ring hollow when emotional needs go unmet.

**Enjambment and Caesura**: The poem uses line breaks to create meaningful pauses and continuations. The break between "And he consumed all of mine" and "About you" forces the reader to pause before the devastating clarification, mimicking the speaker's own reluctant realization.

**Progression and Dissolution**: The poem's structure mirrors its content, moving from unity ("we") to isolation ("I"), from shared ideals to individual destruction. This formal dissolution reinforces the thematic content of disintegration.

**Ironic Reversal**: The partner's statement "you don't give up on the souls you love" becomes a weapon turned against the speaker. This reversal transforms a declaration of loyalty into evidence of its absence.

## Emotional Resonance

"Closer" captures the particular agony of loving someone who is physically present but emotionally absent. The speaker's willingness to be a "safe space" and "sacred heart" reveals not just love but a dangerous level of self-sacrifice—the desire to become a refuge for someone incapable of seeking shelter.

The poem's power lies in its refusal to villainize the partner despite their emotional unavailability and destructive behavior. Instead, it presents a more complex truth: that people can simultaneously love us and fail us, that shared ideals cannot substitute for emotional presence, and that sometimes the most revolutionary act is recognizing when to stop trying to save someone who doesn't want to be saved.

The final transformation into "the little boy that drowned" is both specific and universal. It captures how failed relationships can regress us to our most vulnerable selves, stripping away adult defenses and leaving us as helpless as children. The drowning metaphor suggests not just overwhelming emotion but a complete submersion in another person's inability to love us the way we need.

## Connection to the Collection

Within the broader collection, "Closer" stands as one of the most direct examinations of how love can become a site of self-annihilation. The drowning motif connects directly to the collection's title, while the themes of inadequacy, isolation, and the gap between emotional offering and reception resonate throughout many poems. The specific detail of the partner's "always-drunk anger" and divided attention adds texture to the collection's exploration of how addiction—whether to substances or to unavailable people—shapes and destroys relationships.

The poem also illuminates the collection's recurring interest in the tension between political idealism and personal pain. The "revolutionaries" who wanted "a better life for ourselves / A better life for others" represent the speaker's attempt to locate personal relationships within larger frameworks of meaning and change. Yet the poem ultimately suggests that no amount of shared ideology can bridge the gap created by emotional absence.

"Closer" serves as a cornerstone piece in the collection, demonstrating how proximity without true intimacy can be more isolating than solitude itself. It transforms the simple desire to be close to someone into a complex meditation on love's failures and the courage required to keep offering ourselves even when—especially when—that offering goes unrecognized.
