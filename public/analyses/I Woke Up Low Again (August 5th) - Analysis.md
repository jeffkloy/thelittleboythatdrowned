# "I Woke Up Low Again (August 5th)"

"I Woke Up Low Again (August 5th)" is a stark and unflinching exploration of severe depression, capturing a specific moment in the speaker's mental health struggle with raw honesty. The date in the title transforms what might be a recurring experience into a specific instance, giving the poem the quality of a diary entry—a snapshot of pain that feels both particular and universal.

## The Physical Manifestation of Depression

The poem opens with a visceral detail that immediately establishes the depth of the speaker's depression: "I haven't showered in almost a week." This simple admission carries profound weight, revealing how depression manifests not just emotionally but in the most basic aspects of self-care. The second line's revelation—"I didn't even prepare the tub for fear that I might force myself to drown"—transforms what might seem like simple neglect into an act of self-preservation, a conscious choice to avoid creating opportunities for self-harm.

This opening establishes the poem's unflinching approach to discussing suicidal ideation. The speaker doesn't romanticize or poeticize these thoughts but presents them as a lived reality that must be navigated with practical measures.

## The Paradox of Connection

The second stanza explores the complex relationship between depression and human connection. The speaker "keep[s] staring at [their] phone hoping" for a message from someone they "completely adored," yet simultaneously fears that "every conversation will turn into a one-sided argument." This paradox—desperately wanting connection while fearing its potential for pain—captures one of depression's cruelest aspects: the way it can make the very things that might help feel threatening.

The fear of being misunderstood ("mad at me over something I can never understand") speaks to the isolation that depression creates, not just physically but communicationally. The speaker feels unable to bridge the gap between their internal experience and others' perceptions.

## The Refrain of Anguish

The poem's emotional center lies in its refrain:
"Today, I woke up low again
Today, I woke up anguished again"

The repetition of "again" emphasizes the cyclical nature of depression, the exhausting recurrence of these feelings. The progression from "low" to "anguished" intensifies the emotional register, while the following lines present the internal battle between survival and surrender with stark simplicity: "There's bouts of wanting to survive / There's bouts of wanting to just... die."

The ellipsis before "die" creates a pause that mirrors the speaker's hesitation, the weight of articulating this desire, even in poetry.

## Reframing the Narrative

The fourth stanza represents a crucial shift in perspective. The speaker explicitly rejects the common depression narrative of being a burden: "It's not that I think I'm a burden; I used to." This reframing shows growth and self-awareness, recognizing that the pain comes not from inherent unworthiness but from the specific experience of loving someone "who doesn't love me the way I need to be loved."

The phrase "the way I need to be loved" is particularly significant—it acknowledges that different people have different emotional needs and that there's nothing wrong with having specific requirements for how love is expressed and received. The speaker describes their own love as "gentle," suggesting a tenderness that wasn't reciprocated in kind.

## The Conditional Hope

The poem's turn toward hope is notably conditional: "And maybe if I don't die, then / One day I'll find someone who will love me right." The "if" carries enormous weight—hope exists, but it's predicated on survival, on making the choice to continue despite the pain. This isn't the false optimism often offered to those struggling with mental health; it's a realistic acknowledgment that future happiness requires present endurance.

The qualities the speaker hopes for in future love—someone who will "calm my storms / Or ease my eternal pain"—acknowledge that the depression might not disappear entirely but could be made more bearable through genuine, supportive connection.

## The Final Wish

The poem concludes with two parallel wishes that speak to the exhaustion of constantly struggling:
"I wish I was just happy to be a part of something
I wish I was just happy to be a contender"

These lines express a longing for a simpler relationship with existence—to find joy in participation rather than needing to excel or be chosen. The word "just" in both lines suggests the speaker sees this as a modest wish, though for someone in the depths of depression, such contentment might feel impossibly distant.

## Connection to the Collection

Within this poetry collection, "I Woke Up Low Again" serves as one of the most direct confrontations with mental health struggles. While other poems like "Blackwell's Light" and "Drone Days" touch on mental health through metaphor, this poem's directness creates a different kind of power. It connects to the collection's broader themes of love and loneliness while adding a crucial dimension about the intersection of romantic loss and mental health.

The poem's honesty about suicidal ideation makes it both one of the collection's most difficult and most necessary pieces. It refuses to look away from the darkest moments while still maintaining a thread of hope, however tenuous. In this way, it embodies the collection's overall movement between despair and the possibility of healing, between isolation and the hope for genuine connection.

## Literary Significance

"I Woke Up Low Again" demonstrates how contemporary poetry can address mental health with both artistic merit and social responsibility. The poem doesn't sensationalize or romanticize depression and suicidal ideation; instead, it presents them as lived experiences that require both acknowledgment and careful navigation. The specific date in the title, the conversational tone, and the unflinching honesty all contribute to a piece that feels both deeply personal and widely relatable for those who have experienced similar struggles.

The poem's power lies not in elaborate metaphors or complex imagery but in its direct expression of complex emotional states. It shows how simplicity of language can carry profound emotional weight when addressing subjects that are often shrouded in silence or shame.
