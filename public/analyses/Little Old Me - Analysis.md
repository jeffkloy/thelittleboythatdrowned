# Little Old Me

## Overview

"Little Old Me" is a meditation on self-acceptance that moves through the geography of unfulfilled dreams to arrive at a place of quiet contentment. The poem's title, drawn from its closing lines, carries both self-deprecation and tenderness—a recognition that the speaker's "little old" self is enough. This is a poem about releasing the weight of who we thought we should become and embracing who we actually are.

## Thematic Analysis

### The Catalog of Unlived Lives

The poem opens with a striking construction—"Of all the things I couldn't do"—followed by a vivid list of roads not taken:

> Skydiving over cliffs that crowned the coast
> Marrying my once best friend
> Driving sleek cars toward the shore
> Dancing all night beneath a field of stars

These aren't random regrets but carefully chosen images that suggest a certain kind of life: adventurous, romantic, glamorous, carefree. The imagery carries an almost cinematic quality—the stuff of travel advertisements and romantic comedies. By cataloging these unlived experiences, the speaker acknowledges their former aspirations while simultaneously releasing them.

The word "couldn't" rather than "didn't" is significant. It suggests limitation rather than choice, yet the tone isn't bitter. The phrase "once best friend" is particularly poignant—a relationship that changed shape, perhaps a love unrequited or a timing that never aligned.

### The Weight of Inadequacy

The first stanza's conclusion delivers the poem's emotional pivot:

> At least the weight of feeling inadequate has lifted once again

This line reframes everything that preceded it. The "couldn't do" list isn't about failure—it's about expectations that created crushing pressure. The phrase "once again" hints at a cyclical struggle: the speaker has lifted this weight before and may need to lift it again. There's hard-won wisdom in that acknowledgment.

### The Return to Self

The second stanza is the poem's quiet center:

> Back then, I wanted so much to be strong
> Now, I'm back to whoever I really am
> A place I don't fully comprehend

The contrast between "strong" and "whoever I really am" suggests that strength itself was a costume—an identity the speaker tried to wear rather than inhabit. The return to self is described as coming to "a place," extending the poem's geographic metaphor inward. That this place isn't "fully" comprehended is honest rather than defeated; the self remains mysterious even to itself.

### The Catalog of What Is

The third stanza mirrors the first but transforms it:

> Of all the things I can do
> Live in the greatest city in America
> And still find myself back on the road
> Writing to everyone from Cuba
> With more friends than ever to keep me steady
> And more ideas than before to carry me forward

The shift from "couldn't" to "can" rewrites the earlier losses as present abundance. The specificity here grounds the poem—this isn't abstract possibility but lived reality. Living in "the greatest city in America" while still traveling, still writing, suggests someone who has built a life of creative purpose and genuine connection.

The phrase "keep me steady" stands in direct contrast to the earlier "weight of feeling inadequate." Where once there was crushing pressure, now there is support. Where once there was heaviness, now there is momentum ("carry me forward").

### Acceptance as Arrival

The poem concludes with disarming simplicity:

> In the end,
> I'm just little old me
> What else can I ask for?
> What else can I do?

The rhetorical questions aren't expressions of limitation but of sufficiency. The phrase "little old me" reclaims smallness as intimacy rather than inadequacy. By placing each question on its own line, the poem slows us down, inviting genuine contemplation rather than rushing toward closure. The questions hang in the air separately—the first about desire, the second about action—and together they suggest that the speaker has found peace in both.

## Literary Devices

**Parallel Structure**: The poem's architecture relies on the mirroring of "Of all the things I couldn't do" and "Of all the things I can do," creating a before/after framework that structures the speaker's transformation.

**Catalog/List Form**: The list structure allows the poem to accumulate weight (in the first stanza) and lightness (in the third), using accumulation to build emotional momentum.

**Geographic Metaphor**: Place functions throughout as both literal and figurative—the coast and Cuba are real, but the self is also "a place I don't fully comprehend."

**Rhetorical Questions**: The closing questions function as statements of acceptance rather than genuine inquiry, a technique that invites the reader into the speaker's resolution.

## Connections to the Collection

"Little Old Me" shares thematic DNA with several poems in this collection:

- Like "All The Places You Will Go," it uses geography as a lens for understanding identity and growth
- It echoes "Idealism" in its negotiation between who we hoped to be and who we are
- The theme of self-acceptance connects to "Lovable" and its exploration of identity and self-worth
- The temporal structure—past inadequacy yielding to present acceptance—mirrors the journey in "I Woke Up Low Again (August 5th)"

## Emotional Resonance

What makes "Little Old Me" quietly powerful is its refusal of dramatic transformation. The speaker hasn't conquered their demons or achieved their dreams—they've simply stopped measuring themselves against an impossible standard. The poem suggests that growth isn't always about becoming more; sometimes it's about becoming comfortable with exactly who you already are. In a culture that constantly demands self-improvement, this is a radical act of self-compassion.
