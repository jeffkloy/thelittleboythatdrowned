# "Idealism"

## Overview

"Idealism" presents a raw and deeply vulnerable exploration of unrequited love's aftermath, where hope and resignation wrestle within the speaker's consciousness. The poem captures the specific ache of maintaining friendship with someone you still love romantically, navigating the treacherous waters between supportive presence and painful longing. Through its conversational tone and shifting temporal perspectives, the piece examines how idealization functions as both a comfort and a curse for those who cannot let go.

## Detailed Analysis

### The Contradiction of Hope

The poem opens with an oxymoronic phrase—"difficult wonderful thoughts"—that immediately establishes the central tension. These thoughts are simultaneously painful and pleasurable, representing the masochistic tendency to imagine reconciliation despite knowing its impossibility. The casual phrasing "My mind went, 'What if we worked out?'" captures the spontaneous, almost involuntary nature of hope, how it springs unbidden into consciousness despite our better judgment.

### Self-Awareness and Self-Defeat

The speaker demonstrates acute self-awareness about their condition as "a hopeless romantic," recognizing their tendency to idealize "someone / who would never be theirs again." This metacognitive awareness doesn't protect them from the pain; instead, it adds another layer of suffering—knowing you're engaging in self-destructive thinking but being unable to stop. The line break after "someone" emphasizes the universality of this experience while the completion "who would never be theirs again" delivers the specific, crushing reality.

### The Reality Check

The third stanza provides brutal honesty about the relationship's actual dynamics: fighting, hurting, and fundamentally incompatible dreams. The progression from "mostly think is far-fetched" to "But I really think is stupid" shows the speaker's internal dialogue, moving from diplomatic self-censorship to raw truth. This shift reveals the exhausting mental gymnastics of trying to support someone whose choices you fundamentally disagree with.

### Love as Selflessness

Despite the pain and disagreement, the speaker articulates a mature understanding of love as supporting the other's autonomy: "I would never stop you from your dreams." This section reveals that true care sometimes means letting someone pursue paths that take them away from you. The speaker recognizes that to interfere would be to "never truly cared"—a profound insight into love's requirement for selflessness.

### The Vision Sequence

The poem's emotional center lies in the extended fantasy sequence beginning with "But in my difficult wonderful thoughts." The anaphoric repetition of "I saw" creates a cinematic montage of an imagined future together, progressing from professional success through romantic milestones to domestic happiness. Each image builds on the previous one, creating a complete life narrative that exists only in the speaker's imagination. The progression is notably traditional—career, travel, marriage, children—suggesting a conventional vision of happiness that makes its impossibility even more poignant.

### The Permanence of Loneliness

The speaker's fear of claiming loneliness "as my state of permanence" reveals how past patterns of abandonment create expectations for the future. The phrase "from everyone else in my past" suggests this is not an isolated incident but part of a larger pattern of loss. This historical context transforms the poem from a singular lament into an exploration of how repeated rejection shapes identity.

### The Consolation Prize

The final full stanza outlines the compromised reality the speaker has accepted: friendship as a consolation prize for lost love. The three "I will keep" statements form a litany of supportive actions that maintain proximity to the beloved while denying romantic fulfillment. "Going to lengths to keep you around" acknowledges the effort required to maintain this painful equilibrium.

### The Poet's Lament

The poem's conclusion introduces a meta-poetic element: "But I want to write happy poems again." This line suggests that the emotional state described throughout the poem has infected the speaker's creative output, that their art has become imprisoned by their unfulfilled longing. It's both a wish for emotional healing and an artistic manifesto—a desire to break free from the repetitive cycle of loss that has come to define their work.

## Literary Devices and Technique

The poem employs several key techniques to convey its emotional complexity:

**Temporal Shifting**: The poem moves fluidly between past, present, and imagined future, mimicking how consciousness processes unresolved love.

**Conversational Diction**: The informal language ("My mind went," "But I really think is stupid") creates intimacy while highlighting the speaker's internal dialogue.

**Anaphora**: The repeated "I saw" and "I will keep" create rhythmic intensity while emphasizing both the vividness of fantasy and the determination to maintain connection.

**Line Breaks**: Strategic enjambments, particularly "someone / who would never be theirs again," create suspense and emotional impact.

**Contradiction**: Throughout, the poem embraces paradox—difficult/wonderful, supportive/suffering, together/apart—reflecting the impossible position of unrequited love.

## Themes

### Idealization vs. Reality
The central theme explores how romantic idealization persists despite clear evidence of incompatibility, creating a painful gap between fantasy and reality.

### The Aftermath of Love
The poem examines what remains when romantic love fails but emotional attachment persists, navigating the complex territory between friendship and desire.

### Self-Knowledge and Self-Destruction
The speaker's awareness of their patterns doesn't prevent them from repeating them, exploring how insight alone cannot heal emotional wounds.

### Artistic Expression and Emotional State
The meta-poetic ending suggests how personal pain shapes artistic output, questioning whether happiness is necessary for artistic variety.

## Context and Connections

"Idealism" connects to the collection's broader exploration of loss and longing, particularly resonating with poems like "On Learning" in its examination of accepting relationship limitations. Like "I Woke Up Low Again (August 5th)," it explores the intersection of romantic loss and mental health, though here the focus is on the specific torture of maintained proximity rather than complete separation.

The poem's treatment of writing as both symptom and potential cure links it to the collection's meta-poetic moments, where the act of creation becomes part of the emotional landscape being described. The desire to "write happy poems again" suggests both that happiness once existed and that poetry serves as an emotional barometer.

## Conclusion

"Idealism" achieves its power through unflinching honesty about the gap between what we want and what we can have. The poem refuses easy consolation, instead dwelling in the uncomfortable space where love persists despite its impossibility. By acknowledging both the beauty of the imagined future and the pain of its impossibility, the speaker creates a portrait of mature heartbreak—one that understands love's requirements for selflessness while mourning the personal cost of that understanding.

The poem ultimately suggests that idealism itself might be both the problem and the only available solution—that the capacity to imagine better futures, even impossible ones, might be what allows us to continue despite disappointment. Yet the final line's plea for "happy poems" indicates a desire to break this cycle, to find subjects beyond loss and longing. Whether this is possible remains an open question, one that haunts both the speaker and the collection as a whole.
