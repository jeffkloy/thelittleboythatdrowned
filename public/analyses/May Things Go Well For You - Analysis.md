# "May Things Go Well For You"

## Overview

"May Things Go Well For You" stands as a remarkable testament to love's evolution beyond romantic attachment—a benediction offered in the aftermath of dissolution. The poem captures the complex emotional territory where genuine affection persists despite separation, where the speaker transforms romantic love into something more universal and selfless. Through its direct address and unflinching honesty, the piece explores how we can simultaneously accept responsibility for a relationship's end while struggling to comprehend our partner's emotional response.

## Structure and Movement

The poem employs a circular structure, opening and closing with variations of the same blessing. This repetition creates a sense of ritual or prayer, as if the speaker is trying to manifest goodwill through incantation. Between these bookends, the poem moves through temporal shifts—from present wishes to past reflection to eternal hope—creating a narrative that transcends linear time.

## Detailed Analysis

### The Opening Benediction

The poem begins with striking informality: "Hey, honey." This casual intimacy immediately establishes the complicated space the speaker occupies—no longer partner but not quite stranger. The subsequent wishes—"I hope you find the things you want / I hope you find the people you need"—demonstrate remarkable generosity. The plural "people" carries particular weight, acknowledging that the speaker is no longer among those the addressee needs, yet wishing them fulfillment nonetheless.

### Spatial and Temporal Dislocation

The second stanza creates a stark contrast with "Meanwhile back in our old home." This phrase establishes the speaker as the one left behind, both physically and emotionally. The image of lying and contemplating suggests a kind of paralysis, caught between what was and what might have been. The brutal compression of their relationship's timeline—"How we were marriage-bound / Two months later, into nothing at all"—captures the disorienting speed with which certainty can dissolve into absence.

### The Paradox of Agency

The third stanza reveals the poem's central complexity: "I know how I asked to finally be let go." This admission transforms the speaker from abandoned to abandoner, complicating our emotional response. The metaphor of turning "silence into our love language" is particularly devastating—suggesting how withdrawal became their primary mode of connection. Yet despite initiating the separation, the speaker cannot comprehend their partner's emotional response: "The anger, the distance, the indifference." This incomprehension reveals the fundamental mystery of other minds, how even those we love most deeply can become unknowable.

### The Eternal Blessing

The poem's conclusion amplifies the opening benediction. The repetition of "hey, honey" maintains the intimate address despite everything that has transpired. The declaration "I will always love you" refuses the narrative that love ends with relationships. The final line extends this love temporally: "So may things go well for you for forever." The slightly awkward phrasing of "for forever" rather than simply "forever" creates a sense of emphasis, as if standard language cannot contain the scope of this wish.

## Literary Techniques

### Direct Address

The poem's use of apostrophe—directly addressing the absent beloved—creates immediate intimacy while highlighting absence. Every "you" reminds us that this person is not present to receive these words, transforming the poem into a message that may never reach its intended recipient.

### Juxtaposition

The poem creates meaning through contrasts: past/present, together/apart, understanding/confusion, speech/silence. These oppositions reflect the binary nature of ended relationships—the sharp divide between "us" and "not us."

### Emotional Restraint

Despite its emotional weight, the poem maintains remarkable restraint. There's no blame, no bitterness, no plea for reconciliation. This restraint makes the genuine affection more powerful—love expressed through letting go rather than holding on.

## Themes

### Love Beyond Romance

The poem suggests that love's truest expression might not be possession or presence, but the ability to wish someone well from a distance. It explores how romantic love can transform into something more universal—a benevolent wish for another's happiness regardless of one's own involvement.

### The Limits of Understanding

Despite intimacy and love, the poem acknowledges the ultimate unknowability of another person. The speaker cannot comprehend their partner's emotional response, revealing how even in our closest relationships, we remain mysteries to each other.

### Responsibility and Confusion

The speaker accepts responsibility for requesting the separation while simultaneously expressing confusion about its aftermath. This combination reflects the complex reality of relationship endings, where understanding our own actions doesn't guarantee understanding their consequences.

## Context and Connections

Within the collection, "May Things Go Well For You" offers a mature counterpoint to poems of raw heartbreak. Where pieces like "Idealism" dwell in the pain of unrequited longing, this poem has moved toward acceptance. It connects to "On Learning" in its exploration of fundamental disconnection, but here the speaker has stopped trying to bridge the gap, instead accepting it with grace.

The poem also resonates with the collection's exploration of communication and silence. Like "Delivered (or) Read," it examines how silence can become a form of communication, though here it's acknowledged as the language that killed the relationship rather than sustained it.

## Conclusion

"May Things Go Well For You" achieves its emotional power through its refusal to simplify. It presents a speaker who is simultaneously agent and victim, understanding and confused, letting go and holding on. The poem suggests that maturity in love might mean accepting these contradictions rather than resolving them.

Ultimately, the poem transforms heartbreak into benediction, suggesting that love's highest expression might be the ability to wish happiness for someone who is no longer yours to make happy. In doing so, it offers a vision of love that transcends romantic attachment—a love that survives even its own ending, transformed into pure, selfless hope for another's wellbeing. This transformation from possessive to universal love represents a kind of emotional alchemy, turning the lead of loss into the gold of genuine care.
