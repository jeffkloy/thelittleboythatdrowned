# Taking It Out On The Devils And Angels Raging Inside Us - Analysis

## Overview

"Taking It Out On The Devils And Angels Raging Inside Us" presents a unique structural approach to exploring addiction and its impact on relationships. The poem takes the form of two parallel questionnaires—six questions each for the "devil" (the addicted partner) and the "angel" (the sober partner)—creating a dialogue between opposing states of consciousness. This format transforms the traditional narrative poem into an interactive exploration of addiction's dual nature, where both the numbed and the raw experiences of life are given equal voice.

## Structure and Form

The poem's most striking feature is its unconventional structure as a "curated list," a format that ironically echoes self-help literature while delving into the helplessness often felt in relationships affected by addiction. The parallel structure of six questions for each side creates a mirror effect, suggesting that addiction affects both partners equally, though in opposite ways. The questions progress from surface behaviors to deeper emotional territories, creating a psychological excavation that moves from "why" and "how" to "what does it feel like."

## Central Themes

### The Duality of Addiction

The devil/angel dichotomy represents more than simple good versus evil. The "devil in their bloodstream" embodies the compulsion and self-destruction of addiction, while the "angel in their bloodstream" represents the burden of clarity and sobriety. Notably, the poem complicates traditional moral judgments—the angel's questions reveal that sobriety can feel like a curse rather than a blessing, carrying its own form of suffering through hyperawareness and the inability to escape reality.

### Communication Breakdown

The questionnaire format itself becomes a metaphor for the communication failures in relationships affected by addiction. These are questions that likely were never asked directly, representing the unspoken thoughts and desperate attempts to understand that characterize such relationships. The progression from practical questions ("Why do you drink so obsessively") to emotional ones ("do you feel regret or does anger still pervade") traces the deterioration of dialogue from rational inquiry to emotional plea.

### The Burden of Consciousness

One of the poem's most profound insights lies in its treatment of sobriety not as inherently virtuous but as its own form of suffering. Questions like "How do you wake so easily when there's no fire burning in your soul?" and "does the weight of consciousness still feel like victory?" reveal the exhaustion of constant awareness, suggesting that both numbness and sensitivity can be forms of self-protection against life's difficulties.

## Key Passages and Analysis

### "What's the second thing that pops into your head"

This repeated question structure (appearing in both sets) is particularly revealing. By asking about the "second thing," the speaker acknowledges that first reactions are often defensive or automatic. It's the second thought that might reveal truth—for the addicted partner, perhaps a flicker of recognition of harm caused; for the sober partner, perhaps the temptation to join in the numbness.

### "Ten seconds into yelling, do you feel like there is no way back?"

This question captures the point of no return in arguments fueled by addiction. The specificity of "ten seconds" shows an intimate knowledge of these explosive moments, suggesting lived experience. The parallel question for the angel—"Ten seconds into my verbal assault, do you stand there feeling superior"—reveals the resentment that can build on both sides, where sobriety itself becomes a weapon of moral superiority.

### "After the fight, do you feel regret or does anger still pervade?"

The temporal markers throughout—"when you first started," "over the years," "after the fight"—create a timeline of deterioration. This final question in the devil's section seeks to understand whether any humanity remains after the rage, whether the addiction has completely overtaken the person's emotional responses.

## Language and Tone

The language maintains a clinical distance through its questionnaire format, yet the questions themselves reveal deep emotional investment. Phrases like "verbal assault," "drown in my own rage," and "weight of consciousness" carry visceral impact despite the structured presentation. The tone shifts between accusatory and genuinely curious, suggesting a speaker who vacillates between anger and a desperate need to understand.

## Connection to Collection

This poem's exploration of addiction connects it to other pieces in the collection like "Drugs," "Hard," and "California," but its unique structure sets it apart. While other poems in the collection often focus on the speaker's own struggles, this piece attempts to inhabit both perspectives in a relationship affected by addiction. The theme of communication breakdown links it to poems like "Delivered (or) Read" and "Conversations," though here the failure to communicate is more profound and systemic.

## Contemporary Relevance

The poem's framing as "questions...to help one find closure" speaks to contemporary therapeutic culture while simultaneously revealing the limitations of such frameworks. The questions themselves become a form of poetry therapy, though one that offers no easy answers. In an era of increasing awareness about addiction as a disease rather than a moral failing, the poem's refusal to simply demonize the addicted partner while also acknowledging the real harm caused feels particularly relevant.

## Conclusion

"Taking It Out On The Devils And Angels Raging Inside Us" succeeds in creating a new form for exploring the complex dynamics of relationships affected by addiction. By refusing to privilege either perspective—neither the numbed existence of the addict nor the hyperaware suffering of the sober partner—the poem suggests that both states are responses to pain, different ways of managing an unbearable reality. The questionnaire format, rather than providing answers, opens up space for empathy while acknowledging that some gulfs in understanding may be unbridgeable. The poem ultimately suggests that closure might come not from answers but from the act of formulating the right questions, even if they must remain forever unasked.
