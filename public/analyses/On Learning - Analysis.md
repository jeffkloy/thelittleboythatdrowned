# "On Learning"

"On Learning" explores the painful disconnect between surface-level intimacy and deeper emotional understanding in a relationship. The poem's title operates on multiple levels—referencing both the speaker's unlearned "mother tongue" and the broader failure to truly learn each other as people. This brief but powerful piece captures the moment when one realizes that shared experiences and laughter cannot compensate for a fundamental lack of genuine interest in knowing someone's authentic self.

## Structure and Movement

The poem is organized into two mirroring stanzas, each beginning with a question that sets up a contrast between appearance and reality. The first stanza lists the positive memories and shared connections, building a seemingly strong foundation for the relationship. The second stanza then undermines this foundation with a devastating revelation about what was missing all along.

The parallel structure of "What makes me miss her?" and "What makes me break?" creates a powerful emotional progression from nostalgia to heartbreak, from remembering what was good to understanding why it wasn't enough.

## The Language of Love and Loss

The "mother tongue" becomes the poem's central metaphor, representing not just literal language but the speaker's essential identity, cultural heritage, and authentic self-expression. The lover's dismissal of this language as not sounding "nice" reveals a superficial approach to the relationship—she wanted the speaker's presence but not their depth, their company but not their complexity.

The phrase "waiting for someone else to speak poetically to" is particularly cutting, suggesting that while the speaker was present and trying to share their authentic self, their partner was already looking elsewhere for the kind of romantic expression she valued. The irony is sharp: she rejected the speaker's natural poetry (their mother tongue) while seeking poetry elsewhere.

## Surface Versus Substance

The first stanza catalogs the relationship's surface pleasures: conversations, laughter, inside jokes, shared interests in travel and music. These are the elements that make relationships feel good in the moment, that create the illusion of compatibility. The repetition of "our" emphasizes the apparent mutuality of these connections.

Yet the phrase "the way she always wanted me around" hints at something more possessive than loving—a desire for presence without genuine engagement. The speaker was wanted as an accessory to her life, not as a complete person with their own cultural identity and forms of expression.

## The Weight of Being "Just Around"

The transition from "always wanted me around" to "meant to just be around" reveals the relationship's true dynamic. The speaker realizes they were valued for their availability and companionship but not for who they truly were. This reduction of a person to their mere presence is a form of emotional violence, a denial of their full humanity.

The refusal to learn the speaker's mother tongue becomes symbolic of a larger refusal to engage with difficulty, difference, or depth in the relationship. It represents a partner who wanted love to be easy, pleasant, and accommodating to their preferences, rather than a genuine exchange between two complete individuals.

## Cultural and Personal Identity

The mother tongue represents multiple layers of identity—cultural heritage, family history, and authentic self-expression. The partner's rejection of this language is a rejection of all these aspects of the speaker's identity. Her claim that it didn't "sound nice" reveals an aesthetic superficiality that prioritizes pleasantness over meaning, comfort over connection.

This rejection is particularly painful because language is how we share our deepest selves. To refuse to learn someone's language—literal or metaphorical—is to refuse to learn them.

## Waiting for Poetry Elsewhere

The final line delivers the poem's most devastating insight: the partner wasn't just uninterested in the speaker's language but was actively waiting for someone else to provide the poetry she sought. This reveals a fundamental misdirection of romantic energy—she was physically present but emotionally elsewhere, using the speaker as a placeholder while waiting for her ideal romance.

The irony that she sought poetry while rejecting the speaker's poetic mother tongue suggests she had a narrow, perhaps clichéd idea of what romance and poetry should sound like, unable to recognize the authentic poetry of genuine cultural and personal expression.

## Connection to the Collection

"On Learning" resonates with other poems in the collection that explore failed communication and the pain of being unseen in relationships. Like "Attention," it examines how we can be physically present with someone yet emotionally invisible. The theme of language and communication connects to "Conversations" and "Delivered (or) Read," while the sense of being valued for the wrong reasons echoes throughout poems like "Lovable" and "Taking It Out On The Devils And Angels Raging Inside Us."

The poem's exploration of cultural identity and belonging adds a unique dimension to the collection's treatment of loneliness—the specific isolation of having one's cultural self rejected by an intimate partner.

## Conclusion

"On Learning" is a poignant meditation on the difference between being wanted and being known, between surface compatibility and deep understanding. Through the metaphor of the unlearned mother tongue, the poem exposes how relationships can founder not on dramatic conflicts but on the quiet violence of incuriosity, the subtle rejection of those parts of ourselves that require effort to understand.

The poem suggests that real love requires a willingness to learn—not just the easy, pleasant parts of someone but also the challenging, unfamiliar, perhaps difficult-to-understand aspects that make them who they are. Without this willingness, we are all just waiting for someone else to speak poetically to, missing the poetry that's right in front of us, spoken in a tongue we never bothered to learn.
