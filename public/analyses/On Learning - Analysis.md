# "On Learning"

## Overview

"On Learning" presents a poignant exploration of relationship incompatibility through the lens of cultural and emotional disconnect. The poem's dual structure—what draws the speaker to their partner versus what ultimately breaks them—reveals the painful gap between surface-level compatibility and deeper understanding. At its heart, this is a poem about the importance of mutual effort in love and the devastating realization when that effort flows only in one direction.

## Structure and Form

The poem employs a strategic two-part structure, each beginning with a question that frames the emotional territory to follow. The first section catalogues the positive memories with accumulating momentum, while the second reveals the underlying fractures that made the relationship unsustainable. This binary structure mirrors the speaker's own divided experience—torn between genuine affection and the recognition of fundamental incompatibility.

## Thematic Analysis

### Surface Versus Depth

The opening stanza presents an impressive list of shared experiences and compatibilities: conversations, laughter, inside jokes, common interests, shared cuisines, mutual love of travel and music. These elements suggest a relationship rich in shared experiences and apparent connection. However, the poem reveals these as surface-level bonds that, while meaningful, cannot sustain a relationship lacking deeper mutual investment.

### The Weight of Small Rejections

The second stanza introduces increasingly personal rejections. The partner wanted the speaker to "stick around" but not fully integrate into their life. The request to fix their teeth—identified as "the only reminder left of my suicide attempt"—represents an attempt to erase the speaker's history and pain. The rejection of the beloved dog in their shared bed suggests an unwillingness to accept the full scope of the speaker's life and attachments.

### Language as Metaphor

The poem's emotional climax arrives with the revelation about language. The partner's refusal to learn the speaker's mother tongue transcends mere linguistic preference—it represents a fundamental unwillingness to engage with the speaker's cultural identity and heritage. The partner's dismissal that it "just didn't sound nice" reveals a shallow, aesthetic-based rejection of something core to the speaker's identity.

### The Final Recognition

The devastating final line—"but she was always just waiting for someone else to speak poetically to"—suggests the partner was never truly present in the relationship. This revelation recontextualizes all the positive memories from the first stanza, revealing them as placeholder experiences while the partner waited for something or someone else.

## Literary Techniques

The poem employs careful pacing, building from light, positive memories to increasingly heavy revelations. The use of "But mostly" as a transitional phrase emphasizes that among all the hurts, the linguistic rejection cut deepest. The verb choice of "break" rather than "hurt" or "sadden" emphasizes complete fracture rather than mere damage.

## Contemporary Relevance

"On Learning" speaks to modern challenges in cross-cultural relationships and the importance of genuine cultural exchange versus superficial multiculturalism. In an increasingly globalized world, the poem asks: what does it mean to truly embrace another person's background rather than simply tolerating it? The poem suggests that love requires active learning—not just of preferences and habits, but of the deeper currents that shape identity.

## Connection to Collection

This poem resonates with other pieces in the collection that explore themes of incomplete connection and one-sided emotional investment. The emphasis on communication (or its failure) links it to poems like "Delivered (or) Read" and "Conversations," while the exploration of identity connects it to works examining self-worth and belonging.

## Conclusion

"On Learning" ultimately presents love as an active verb requiring continuous effort and genuine curiosity about one's partner. The title itself becomes ironic—while the speaker was willing to learn and adapt, their partner remained stubbornly monolingual, both literally and emotionally. The poem suggests that relationships fail not from lack of common ground, but from unwillingness to explore the terrain that feels foreign. In refusing to learn the speaker's language, the partner refused to learn the speaker themselves, choosing instead to wait for poetry in a tongue they already understood.
