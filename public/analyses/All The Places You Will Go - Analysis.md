# All The Places You Will Go

"All The Places You Will Go" is a contemplative meditation on travel, self-discovery, and the irreplaceable nature of lived experience. The poem maps a journey not just through geographical coordinates but through states of being, capturing how places become vessels for transformation and how movement through space catalyzes movement through the self.

## Thematic Foundation: Geography as Self-Discovery

The opening stanza operates as a personal atlas, each city representing not merely a destination but a distinct emotional and psychological revelation. The structure—"I [verb] in [city]"—creates a litany that mirrors the accumulation of experience through travel. "I lost my head once in Amsterdam" introduces the theme of surrender to experience, while "I tasted luxury in Bangkok" and "I overindulged myself in Las Vegas" suggest varying degrees of indulgence and excess. Yet between these moments of abandon, we find deeper recognitions: "I realised I could love a ghost in Cape Town" introduces the melancholic awareness that love can persist beyond long-term physical presence, while "I learned who I was in San Francisco" and "I found my calling in Sydney" mark moments of genuine self-discovery. The stanza culminates with "I felt like myself most with newfound friends in Tokyo," suggesting that authentic selfhood often emerges not in solitude but in connection with others.

What makes this catalogue powerful is its specificity—each city holds a distinct emotional signature, yet the poem never explains what about these places catalyzed these experiences. This restraint honors the ineffable nature of place-based revelation while inviting readers to project their own geographic memories onto the framework.

## Temporal Perspective: Travel as Inheritance and Choice

The second stanza shifts from geographical inventory to temporal reflection, introducing the speaker's relationship with travel as something inherited ("I've been travelling since I was a child") yet not fully embraced in its original form ("Never really liked the way we went about it"). This tension between familial inheritance and personal autonomy runs throughout the collection, appearing in poems like "California" and "Furthest and Closest" where family patterns both enable and constrain individual growth.

The acknowledgment "But I knew that every city and every park would be wild / And that in my heart, there'd be some places that would fit" reveals a sophisticated understanding that not all places will resonate equally—travel is as much about discovering which geographies align with one's inner landscape as it is about accumulating stamps in a passport. The rhyme scheme (about it / would fit) creates a sense of inevitable alignment, suggesting that despite resistance to inherited travel patterns, the speaker recognized an essential truth: some places would feel like home.

## Prescriptive Turn: Advice to the Future Self (or Reader)

The third stanza shifts into direct address, transforming personal reflection into universal counsel. "Of all the places you will go / Each place will ignite a different spark of yours" reframes travel not as consumption of experience but as a series of ignitions—each location unlocking different aspects of selfhood. This metaphor of sparks suggests that aspects of ourselves lie dormant until activated by specific environments, an idea that resonates with the collection's broader exploration of how external circumstances reveal internal truths.

The exhortation "Keep exploring, never just outright say no" carries the urgency of someone who has learned through regret, while "Don't let your career or relationships stop you from going on tour" explicitly names the forces that curtail wanderlust. The addition of "You'll never regain that time that made you not go" introduces a note of warning—the opportunities for formative travel are time-bound, and the self that emerges from exploration cannot be retroactively cultivated.

## Paradox of Experience: Jadedness and Surprise

The closing line—"You might eventually grow jaded, but you'll never stop surprising yourself"—encapsulates a profound paradox about sustained engagement with the world. It acknowledges that repeated exposure can dull wonder ("grow jaded") while simultaneously asserting that the capacity for self-surprise persists. This tension between weariness and discovery reflects the broader emotional landscape of the collection, where hope and disillusionment coexist without resolution.

The poem ends on this single line, unanchored by a stanza, giving it the weight of a hard-earned truth. It suggests that the goal of travel is not to maintain perpetual wide-eyed wonder but to continue the practice of discovery even as the novelty fades. The self remains mysterious even to itself, and movement through the world keeps revealing unexpected dimensions of being.

## Craft and Structure: The Accumulative Effect

The poem employs a structure that mirrors its thematic concern with accumulation—the opening stanza's list of cities builds like a travelogue, while the subsequent stanzas unpack the meaning of this accumulation. The shift from past tense ("I lost," "I tasted") to present tense advisory ("Keep exploring," "Don't let") creates a sense of wisdom distilled from experience being offered forward.

The rhyme scheme becomes looser as the poem progresses, moving from the tight consonance of the opening (Amsterdam/Bangkok/Cape Town/Las Vegas/London/San Francisco/Sydney/Tokyo) to the more relaxed rhyme of the middle stanza (about it / would fit) to the emphatic rhyme of the final stanza (go / no / tour / go). This loosening mirrors the movement from rigid documentation to reflective advice to urgent counsel.

## Connection to the Collection

"All The Places You Will Go" shares thematic DNA with several poems in the collection. Like "Furthest and Closest," it explores how physical distance and emotional proximity interweave. Like "California" and "On Island Time," it positions specific places as sites of transformation. And like "On Learning" and "Our Truest Intentions," it offers hard-won wisdom about how to live fully despite the inevitable jadedness that comes with experience.

The poem's concern with regret—"You'll never regain that time that made you not go"—echoes the temporal anxiety that runs through pieces like "Big Plans," "Drone Days," and "Ten Years," where the speaker grapples with how time constrains possibility. Yet unlike poems that dwell in loss, this piece maintains a forward momentum, insisting that even jaded, the self retains the capacity for surprise.

## Conclusion

"All The Places You Will Go" functions as both personal travelogue and universal encouragement, mapping how geographical exploration becomes a form of self-archeology. It argues that the places we visit don't merely provide backdrops for experience—they actively ignite different aspects of who we are, revealing facets of ourselves that might otherwise remain dormant. The poem's power lies in its refusal to romanticize travel while still insisting on its transformative necessity, acknowledging jadedness while asserting the enduring capacity for self-surprise. It's a meditation on how we become ourselves through movement, how places hold our transformations, and how the choice to keep exploring matters more than the inevitability of weariness.
